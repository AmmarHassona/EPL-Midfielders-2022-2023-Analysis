# EPL-Midfielders-2022-2023-Analysis
This project aimed to analyze the top midfielders in the Premier League and their impact on the league and their teams based on the data from the "English Premier League 22-23 Season Stats" dataset on Kaggle. This simple project gives a small dive into data analysis and a visualization of the data in football, especially the Premier League.

The dataset I chose was based on my passion towards football. In addition, choosing a dataset which I could understand easily in detail helped me in the project. Not only was this a great start for dealing with data, but it was also an eye-opener as to how much we can do with data. 
Here is the link to the dataset on Kaggle:

Based on the data for the 2022-2023 season, I concluded the following players as the top-performing midfielders in the league based on their performances and their impact on their teams:
- Kevin De Bruyne
- Bukayo Saka
- Michael Olise
- Trent Alexander-Arnold
- James Maddison
  
This list is not listed in order as each player performed better in certain situations based on their position, role in the team, the overall strength of their team, the quality of their teammates and much more.
