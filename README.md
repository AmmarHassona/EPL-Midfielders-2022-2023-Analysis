# EPL-Midfielders-2022-2023-Analysis
This project aimed to analyze the top midfielders in the Premier League and their impact on the league and their teams based on the data from the "English Premier League 22-23 Season Stats" dataset on Kaggle. This simple project gives a small dive into data analysis and a visualization of the data in football, especially the Premier League.

The dataset I chose was based on my passion towards football. In addition, choosing a dataset which I could understand easily in detail helped me in the project. Not only was this a great start for dealing with data, but it was also an eye-opener as to how much we can do with data. 
Here is the link to the dataset on Kaggle:

I have included a document which has my insights and my final thoughts on the analysis.
