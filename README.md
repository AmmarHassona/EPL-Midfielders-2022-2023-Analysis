# EPL-Midfielders-2022-2023-Analysis

# Introduction:
This project aimed to analyze the top midfielders in the Premier League and their impact on the league and their teams based on the data from the "English Premier League 22-23 Season Stats" dataset on Kaggle. This simple project gives a small dive into data analysis and a visualization of the data in football, especially the Premier League.

The dataset I chose was based on my passion towards football. In addition, choosing a dataset which I could understand easily in detail helped me in the project. Not only was this a great start for dealing with data, but it was also an eye-opener as to how much we can do with data. 
Here is the link to the dataset on Kaggle:

# Insights:
Based on the data, the top-performing midfielders for the 2022-2023 season in the Premier League were the following:
Kevin De Bruyne
Bukayo Saka
Michael Olise
Trent Alexander-Arnold
James Maddison
This list is not listed in order as each player performed better in certain situations based on their position, role in the team, the overall strength of their team, the quality of their teammates and much more. I have based these selections on these playersâ€™ key passes, assists, expected assists, 90s played, attacking passes, completed passes, shots vs team shots, and assists vs team goals. 

# Conclusion:
The data shows how important midfielders are for their team and how much impact they have on the league. Surprisingly only 2/5 of the players from the list are midfielders, Kevin De Bruyne and James Maddison. Bukayo Saka and Michael Olise are wingers, and Trent Alexander-Arnold is a full-back. Despite the initial aim of the analysis being the importance of midfielders on the league and their teams, this conclusion can depict that not all top midfielders are midfielders. This is an important conclusion as this shows how each team utilizes their players in different areas of the pitch and how these teams tactically advance on the pitch.
